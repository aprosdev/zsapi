		Another slow day. Today, the registration process needs to be completed.

	11:13
		Just finished making some nice looking sequence diagrams for the registration/order process. Now, my goals are to finish the business registration process (everything but stripe).
		- Create business
		- Create primary location
		- Fake stripe
		- Create order
		- Send admin email
		- Confirm order and create beacon
		- Activate location once beacon is received

		The capybara test works! A user confirms their email, signs in, then is directed to the new business page! Next, we need to implement the details that will create a business and their first location.

		The user controller with devise is tougher than I thought. I've decided to just deal with creating the business and location AFTER the user has confirmed their account. I did, however, modify the controller to allow for the "first" and "last" names to be saved on creation.

		The last thing I did was create a capybara test for the registration pae to ensure that the names were saved... they are! Now, create a capybara test that will sign up and go to the confirmation URL. This page should redirect the user to create a new business and location.

	14:24
		Today is the day of back to the future! I'm going to get a little more structured and follow through with the PDF as I go through the schedule. Businesses aren't able to be created nor modified, so this will be added now.

		Retiring for night. Just added the visit! method for customers. Tomorrow I should add campaigns.

	22:42
		Added beacon, location, and visit specs. Will probably postpone redemptions until tomorrow because I didn't realize locations were not finished.	

	21:47
		Finished the capybara testing for the current stage of the customers index	

	21:13
		Earlier I updated the MySQL ERD to the new schema based off of memory. Today was a long day with school, so I haven't started on this project until now. It's late, so my goals are to:
		- Setup capybara testing for the customers
		- Build the "Visit" association
		- Build the "Redemption" association

		The customers are setup to display points and listing depending on the current_user's business ID. The export is also ready. The next step is to just look through the PDF and ensure that the controller tests cover the page. Also, setup the view and run simple capybara testing. After customers, we'll move onto the campaign system.
