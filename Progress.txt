	17:18+ (not logging time)
		Working on the campaign redemption process for the API.

8/29/15
	21:23-
		Setup the referral and share link models. Also, I've written down how a referrer will be credited. ** I need to rename "customer" to "referrer" in the Referral table to prevent confusion. I might consider doing this to other models as well in order to keep the confusion at a minimum.

	19:34+
		Working on the campaign API.

8/28/15

	16:52-
		Got the form errors done! Login is working, just need to fix the remember me and alignment. After that, set the other devise pages. Then add yelp, tonight!

	14:01
		WOW, got distracted. The logout button didn't work because the link JS was jacked up, so I ended up converting the location and account menus in the header to use bootstrap's dropdowns.

	10:27+
		Setting up the login/register/password/logout pages.

8/26/15
	16:37-

	20:37
		Payments work just fine! The user can now order and place a subscription.

8/21/15
	19:29-
		Stripe integration is coming together nicely. Now I just need to ensure that new stripe customer gets subscribed to the plan. After that, I need to ensure that the page gets redirected and the admin notified. This will lead into styling the success page, the admin beacon create page, and the user confirm pages.

	13:12-
		Took payment info off of the locations form and set it up on its own payment form. I also added a status to the locations to easily handle active/pending. Right now I'm working on getting the stripe form setup, which is actually quite easy! Just need to test it and see if it works. After that, we should have everything we need to init the beacon creation process.

	10:37+
		Finishing out the UUID and confirmation screens for locations

8/20/15
	21:52-

	20:43+
		Finishing the locations form.

	19:55-

	15:08-

	12:48
		Make many new changes to CSS. Now working on getting the campaign crop window all sorted out. Then I'll fix the uploads for the customer and business pages as well.

8/13/15
	21:13-
		Completely re-did the buttons UI in CSS. And also got working dropdowns for the buttons! ** Change the HTML for the already-completed pages to use the new buttons. Then, set the campaign browse button to work the same as the cutomers browse button PLUS add the handle separately for the campaigns. After this, buttons should all be good!

	15:18
		Got the modals working. Got the modal implemented into the business page but it is not working. ** I'll do this when I add in the real modal preview. Working on the customers pages now.

	14:11+
		Back to working on the campaign modals

	13:14-

	20:15+
		Working on the campaigns page and then going to the business form page

	19:39-
		Almost finished with campaign page. Need to fix the progress list steps

	19:15+

		Campaign form almost done. Once complete, do older already-done forms.

	14:10+

	13:50-

	12:28+
		Finishing the work on the campaign form's markup and styles. This will bleed into past and future forms.

8/5/15
	16:53+
		Looking over the campaign form.

7/31/15
	19:33-
		The styles are all jacked up. What needs to be done is: **
			1) Look in the form for all classes that are used by the form
			2) Remove them!
			3) Make it work in the styles.
			4) Rinse and repeat for all forms.

	19:14+
		Fixing the small style issues on campaigns form (input fields too wide).

	16:03-
		Got the greeing index and most of the form page done. Just need to get a few of the input field fixed. **Then all I need to do is test the form. **Also, I need to get paperclip to work with the cropped image!

		Tomorrow, I will finish the form and single page (with highcharts). Then move onto customers!

	11:00+
		Working on everything campaigns today!	

7/30/15
	11:34
		The index page went smoothly (**although the new button isn't styled). Working on the form now.

	09:30+
		Starting in on the greetings page. Today needs to be a lot of work!

7/29/15
	21:19-
		Integrated most of the design and assets. It wasn't easy! Also found a few Firefox bugs and reported them to Artur. **Tomorrow I will start on the greeting page. Once all pages are integrated with the new design, I will start testing functionality (forms and whatnot).

	14:32+
		Integrating the design into the app. After all is said and done, will begin integrating each section page by page.

7/24/15
	16:07-
		Added the **untested facebook post-to-wall-with-image method in the campaign controller.

	15:59
		Added the image uploading capability to twitter when posting a campaign (not tested). Now adding to facebook. Once these are done, the campaign form will be pretty much completed. **Except for adding the schedule title/select

	15:07
		Got the campaigns index and show done. Working on the campaign form now

	13:42
		Completed the greetings front-end. Moving on the campaigns now

	09:27
		Working on the greetings index. Need to open the PDF because it's not setup in the HTML

	08:49+
		Yesterday got the dashboard and biz profile pages ready (except for the steps). Now working on greetings index

7/23/15
	15:06+
		Adding in more front-end modules to be ready for the design integration. Starting with the dashboard.

7/22/15
	14:44+
		Mapping out the redemptions model

7/21/15
	17:01-
		Got the index results filtered and datable for the receipts! I also moved around the campaigns so that they are referenced as /location/:loca_id/campaigns -- this is all in a new branch called "locations_with_sub_resources". Merging to dev branch

	12:31
		Going to map out the redemptions model

	12:29
		Finished the receipt show and email items. The index filter is not completed yet because I'm having trouble with the "datable" routing concern. Now, only allowing 1 CC or Mailchimp account per user. --- Cancel that.

	11:18+
		Finishing the receipts front-end. Index, single, and email link

7/17/15
	15:36
		Decided not to store current locations in the session for now. Not necessary at this point

	15:26
		Adding the current location to the current user's session

	14:00+
		Adding a publish button to the business form

7/16/15
	9:57

	9:26+
		Writing the articles for the help docs in teamworkpm

7/15/15
	11:59-
		Got greetings working in the controller for the most part. Got all the nested attribute selectors setup. Now working on a test that ensures the greeting is assigned to the location when selected from the dropdown. This isn't needed 100%, so I need to move onto something else and note this.

	17:53-
		Locations index is done, so is the TOS. I'm working on the CREATE tests for the location. The payment form is separate from the location form, so I need to render it in as a partial. Additionally, the payment form needs to be setup to take payments directly on the site. The test already has the Stripe token creator for testing, I just need to setup the form and submit information. Then, I need to finish the CREATE tests for location.

	11:50+
		Today I'll be working on the locations checklist:
			- Locations index separate by status
			- Create forms, show greeting options
			- Show payment information
			- Link to TOS
			- Confirm locations
			  - Create form
			  - Link to from index
			- Single location
			  - Show overview of stats

7/13/15
	22:41-
		What a long day! Memberships setup, greeting on check in and check out, re-structured the greetings, visits, and memberships. All tests implemented and passing!

	11:55
		Corrected the customer spec.

	11:41+
		Correcting the customer's spec (since the change of the wallet setup)

	10:51
		Renamed all occurrances of 'wallet' to 'membership'. This is the new association model between customers and a business

7/11/15
	13:05-
		The testing is complete! All looks well.

	11:46+
		Finishing the CSV test noted from yesterday. Then onto greetings! The goal today is to get half of the greetings setup (as per the gantt chart)

7/10/15
	14:27-
		Working on the "twice" import mail test. Can't post twice, so ***I need to manually create the users from the valid CSV and then run post.

	14:18
		Emails are being sent to newly imported customers!

	10:21+
		Finishing the customer email notifier

7/8/15
	16:51-
		Got the import method completed finally! And the wallets all straightened out as well. *Now, just need to email the newly imported users.

	14:53
		The new customer method works for creating a customer and wallet for an import.

	12:53-
		Restructured the wallet and customer system and removed over ~40 lines of code! Now finishing up the "find_or_create_with_wallet" method for Customer

	11:46+
		Setting up the import to run through businesses instead of customers.

7/7/15
	23:15-
		Working on the import system. We need to be able to easily set "points" on create. That's all we're lacking!

	21:20+
		Working on importing customers from CSV and notifying those new customers of the Zippyspot app!

7/6/15
	22:00-
		The campaign form is what I'm working on. Getting the schedules all setup. Today, I was able to learn about "enum" and add it to campaigns. I also setup the campaign index and filter, as well as the form and show page. * Need to finish schedule system.

	16:43+
		Starting on the campaign checklist now.

7/3/15
	20:18-
		Dev branch is good to go with the business image. business_social branch is almost ready, but still getting some nil errors. I might just leave it how it is for now and return if I have extra time....right. Next up, campaigns!

	18:50-
		Paperclip is setup for business. *Still need to modify according to actual needed sizes. Also, in the "business_social" branch I'm trying to refactor the identities.

	18:27+
		Setting up paperclip for business

	14:47-
		Constant contact integrated and working!

	10:30+
		Working on constant contact


7/2/15
	17:39-
		The mailchimp works! Now I just need to ask the user which list to subscribe them to, then it's on to constant contact!

	17:05
		Have been working on the mailchimp integration all day. Got it working! All that is left is to subscribe a user to the list.

7/1/15
	16:06
		Twitter successfully logs in and tweets!

	13:03
		Helpful guide for setting up oauth: http://willschenk.com/setting-up-devise-with-twitter-and-facebook-and-other-omniauth-schemes-without-email-addresses/

	12:05+
		Adding the identity model and setting up facebook/twitter omniauth controllers so the business user can integrate those social items.

6/30/15
	16:46
		Adding simple page views to the app so I can navigate it as the business user and work on the social integrations.

	16:22
		Got the campaigns and schedules completed!

	13:29+
		Finally got an idea on how to setup the biz profile social connections. I will complete this after I work on the campaign start/end problem for an hour.

6/26/15
	21:19-
		All of the schedules work!! Now I need to add in the campaign start/end restrictions. The query is setup, but the "Schedule" class method has no association to the campaigns! So the current approach will not work. We need to associate it somehow, OR, grab the schedules individually and loop through them to see when their respective campaigns (if exists) starts and ends.

	18:54+
		Working on schedule specs for "every monday"

	14:37-
		Left working on the schedule spec array query.

	13:01-
		Lunch time. Working on the schedule specs

	12:12+
		Finishing up the basic campaign specs and setting up schedules.

6/25/15
	20:46-
		Setup the models for campaign and schedules (yay!). Now working on the campaign model and basic tests. *Having a problem where the "acive,inactive,features" methods are screwing up with the "Where" method. Not sure why... After basic model is setup, need to setup basic models for schedules, as well as many different factories of settings for schedules. Then it's onto testing the schedules!

	18:58+
		Working on setting up campaign models

	10:13+
		Fixing the ERD and setting up campaigns.

6/24/15
	12:26+
		Working on seeding the heroku environment.

6/23/15
	14:38
		Finish the greetings specs. Started on mocking campaigns, but that is a waste of time. Campaigns will be finished within a few days and the api will be updated then. Going to upload to heroku now.

	12:12+
		Passing controller specs for greetings.

6/22/15
	18:34-
		Working on the "Greetings" now, which will lead to the campaigns. The user can create many greetings, but only 1 per location can be used. Therefore, I need to update the prototype to include this list of "index" functionality for greetings. Also, add "index" to the greetings controller and routes.
		  Tomorrow:
		  * Greeting controller specs PASS
		  * Mock campaigns and feeds
		  * Serialize friend IDs when saving facebook
		  * Ask greg if friends are saved on google+ as well
		  * Authentication for api (ehh)
		  * Setup heroku and run test on api

	15:03
		Finished the locations api calls! Now starting on campaigns

	13:54+
		Continuing the fetch nearby call.

	11:30+
		Testing the "fetch nearby" locations call, then onto the map call. After testing, moving onto the campaigns!

6/20/15
	21:45-
		Finished the visit api controls. Just started working on "fetch_nearby" for locations. It should work, but we need a way to test it. After this, move onto the location_in_map api call. Then onto campaigns!

	20:45+
		Working to finish the visit model, then finishing the fetch location method.

	19:54-
		Working on the locations api and needed to update the visits. Instead of many visit rows per location, it will increment. I'm implementing a class method for Visit which will do this. I just finished writing the test, now need to implement the code. Then finish working on the location get api call.

	11:22-
		Completed the receipt uploading functionality. **Need to add paperclip to campaign models when they are created.

	08:54+
		Ok, I'm skipping authentication for now and just writing all of the API controllers to pass tests. I'll manually input the user until I can figure out testing. This way, 1 little thing will not continue to hold me up.

6/19/15
	22:02-
		Having a hard time with the authentication! Need to just skip it, finish the API, then worry about token authentication!

	20:14+
		Finishing the new authentication header and testing the customer api.

	19:30-
		Working on setting up the authentication header for api tests. This will solve the problem of having to set get or post params.

	12:37+
		Today I plan on getting the customer (sign in, out, fetch), locations (fetch, find near, find in map), notification (send), and receipt (send) api calls finished. If I have time, I want to be able to create mock JSON for the visits

6/17/15
	18:10-
		Got rocket pants setup and ready to go. Got the routes ready. Now I just need to implement all of the controllers. Additionally, I'll need to create the campaigns, redemptions, and visits for the api to be ready!

6/16/15
	17:27-
		Got the beacons and locations all finished! *I might end up converting more request specs into controller specs now that I understand them better. ** Next step is to create the API. So get ready!

	11:00+
		Working on completing the beacon spec. After that, customer validation of location. Need to finish both of these today and start on the API!

6/14/15
	8:55-
		The @payment var is showing as nil in the beacon spec. Which doesn't allow any of the new tests to run. Fix this.
		
	8:47+
		Working on the beacon "it" tests real quick.

6/13/15
	23:10-
		Got the payment tests done. Got the beacon testing ready to be implemented (the "its" are there). Need to finish the "its" in the beacon, then move onto the customer validating a location. That is all! Finally, run all tests.

	22:13+
		Trying to finish thoses tests real quick.

	20:18-
		Got the request specs working. Now, need to get the confirm key from the email and test the beacon creator. After that, test the location validator once a user received the beacon via mail. That should be all the tests.

	16:43+
		Cut out of office fast yesterday, couldn't log. Stripe is integrated on the front end, and also the test end. Working on the payment controller now to see if the whole beacon/location process gets completed.

6/12/15
	09:08+
		Diagramming the location order process again. Then, starting to test the process.

6/11/15
	22:01-
		Got the stripe integration done, as well as the order creation and the beacon creation! Everything should be set for testing now. Need to test: New Location > New Order (payment details) > Click link in email > Create beacon. After this, test the Location "Confirm UUID" code for when the business owner received the iBeacon in the mail. After that, if tests look good, we're good to go!

	20:38+
		My goal for tonight is to complete the stripe integration, breacon creation, and beacon approval. Let's see how close we get!

	17:24-
		So, we're going to separate the Business, Location, and Order creation. I'm working to install Stripe so that we can get it out of the way and test the Beacon order process. Currently working in orders_controller.rb. I need to setup the routes for /locations/#/order/new because the order needs to be built from the location selected.

	15:45+
		Another slow day. Today, the registration process needs to be completed.

	11:13-
		Just finished making some nice looking sequence diagrams for the registration/order process. Now, my goals are to finish the business registration process (everything but stripe).
		- Create business
		- Create primary location
		- Fake stripe
		- Create order
		- Send admin email
		- Confirm order and create beacon
		- Activate location once beacon is received

6/10/15
	17:56-
		The capybara test works! A user confirms their email, signs in, then is directed to the new business page! Next, we need to implement the details that will create a business and their first location.

	17:05
		The user controller with devise is tougher than I thought. I've decided to just deal with creating the business and location AFTER the user has confirmed their account. I did, however, modify the controller to allow for the "first" and "last" names to be saved on creation.

		The last thing I did was create a capybara test for the registration pae to ensure that the names were saved... they are! Now, create a capybara test that will sign up and go to the confirmation URL. This page should redirect the user to create a new business and location.

	14:24
		Today is the day of back to the future! I'm going to get a little more structured and follow through with the PDF as I go through the schedule. Businesses aren't able to be created nor modified, so this will be added now.

6/9/15
	22:58
		Retiring for night. Just added the visit! method for customers. Tomorrow I should add campaigns.

	22:42
		Added beacon, location, and visit specs. Will probably postpone redemptions until tomorrow because I didn't realize locations were not finished.	

	21:47
		Finished the capybara testing for the current stage of the customers index	

	21:13
		Earlier I updated the MySQL ERD to the new schema based off of memory. Today was a long day with school, so I haven't started on this project until now. It's late, so my goals are to:
		- Setup capybara testing for the customers
		- Build the "Visit" association
		- Build the "Redemption" association

6/8/15
	20:04
		The customers are setup to display points and listing depending on the current_user's business ID. The export is also ready. The next step is to just look through the PDF and ensure that the controller tests cover the page. Also, setup the view and run simple capybara testing. After customers, we'll move onto the campaign system.
